# VMWare and Kali Linux Installation

This project will demonstrate how to properly install both **VMWare Workstation** and **Kali Linux.** **VMWare** allows the users to set up virtual machines on a single physical machine and have its own operating system. **Kali Linux** is an operating system based on Debian Linux that is mainly designed for tasks such as forensics and penetration testing.

## VMWare Installation

You can go to https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html and download **VMWare** from there.
Locate the installation file and run the program

You can choose to have the enhanced keyboard options, which enables users to have better handeling with international keyboards. I opted not to install the driver

The next step asks if you want to have update checks on startup. I opted to keep it checked to have opportunities to improve my experience of **VMWare** with updates.

After the setup it should look like this:

Go to the Help option and choose the Licensce Key option. You can choose to do the 30 day trial or input the key if you bought the product. If you don't input the key, you will not be able to utilize **VMWare** with all its functionalities
